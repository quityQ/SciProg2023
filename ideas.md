# Possible ideas
- figure out whether rating of a movie correlates with its budget
    - pull a list of movies (finite to beign with; 2020 onwards maybe)
    - cleanup data so only title, rating and budget are available
    - display on a point graph
- show viewing habits over time, see if there are any relations to season (for example)
- can we derive whether movies with male leads are in general more expensive than female leads (gender pay gap)
- which countries produce the most successful movies (internatinality, nationaly)
